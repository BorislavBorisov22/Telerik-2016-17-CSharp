--------
#1 - class CreateStudentCommand did not implement the ICommand interface
#2 - class Student => ListMarks method returned an empty string when the student had no marks instead of returng a correct response message
#3 - class TeacherAddMarkCommand when getting teacher and student by id we are getting a teacher with the id of
the student and a student with the id of the teacher, in other words the ids are swapped when getting teacher and student from the dictionaries
by id
#4 - class Student => ListMarks method should return a string not only with the marks of the students when their
count is more than zero but should also first append a line containing "The student has these marks:"
#5 - Grade enum => Some of the values were missing (not all from 1 to 12 grade were available)
