01. Bug in the Delete method of the PackageRepository
class where when the package to delete is found but
it is a dependancy of another package in the collection
should stop the method execution there, but instead it
continues and still tries removing the package.

02. Another problem I found is at the GetAll method of the
PackageRepositoryClass where a private method that was
that adds some items in the packages and messes up with 
the collection is called. The method was just forgotten
to be removed because the commnets on it say that it was
for test purposes.
